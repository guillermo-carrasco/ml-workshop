    "Decision trees leave you with a difficult decision. A deep tree with lots of leaves will overfit because each prediction is coming from historical data from only the few houses at its leaf. But a shallow tree with few leaves will perform poorly because it fails to capture as many distinctions in the raw data.\n",
    "\n",
    "Even today's most sophisticated modeling techniques face this tension between underfitting and overfitting. But, many models have clever ideas that can lead to better performance. We'll look at the random forest as an example.\n",
    "\n",
    "The random forest uses many trees, and it makes a prediction by averaging the predictions of each component tree. It generally has much better predictive accuracy than a single decision tree and it works well with default parameters. If you keep modeling, you can learn more models with even better performance, but many of those are sensitive to getting the right parameters.\n",
    "\n",
    "We build a random forest model similarly to how we built a decision tree in `scikit-learn` - this time using the `RandomForestRegressor` class instead of `DecisionTreeRegressor`."

As you may be imagining, there is a better way to do this than with for loops. There is a technique called **Grid Search**. When running a grid search, you will basically specify the number of parameters that you want to try, and the algorithm will fit a model _for every possible combination_. This means that you need to be careful, or the computational cost will grow exponentially. \n",
